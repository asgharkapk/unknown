# README — Critique of BPSR’s Menu / UI System

## Overview

This is not a bug log, but a user-driven critique of the **menu system & UI organization** in *Blue Protocol: Star Resonance* (BPSR).
While the game has strengths in world design, graphics, and progression mechanics, its menus and UI systems are often seen as cluttered, unintuitive, and overly reliant on nested layers. Many players feel the system undermines immersion and adds friction to basic tasks.

---

## Major Issues & Pain Points

### 1. **Excessive nesting and buried options**

Players frequently report that **important actions are buried too deep** under submenus, making them hard to locate.

> “SR’s menu system can be unintuitive. There are often too many nested menus, making it difficult to locate specific options.” ([Reddit][1])
> “The UI is atrocious. The gachas and cash shop are awful. … The bound currency but then paid currency just shouldn’t exist, it should all just be …” ([Reddit][2])
> “Aside from the menus just being annoying …” ([Reddit][3])

Even someone who invested heavily in leveling describes the interface as “horribly clunky”:

> “UI: … clunky, it does its job, but just barely and in unintuitive and unconstructive ways.” ([Reddit][4])

---

### 2. **Clutter, overload, and “gacha-style” feel**

Many players complain that the UI is overcrowded with **currency windows, popups, reward screens, micro-stores**, etc., giving it the feel of a mobile gacha game rather than a polished MMO.

> “The menus and UI and currencies really pissed me off. It’s overly bloated in that aspect and really makes it feel like a gacha game.” ([Reddit][5])
> “You constantly have to click through dozens of reward screens, daily missions, pop-ups, and unnecessary systems. It’s like playing a typical mobile game rather than a proper MMO.” ([Steam Community][6])

A Steam review succinctly describes the issue:

> “There are so many menus inside of menus inside of menus that even after five hours of gameplay I’ve barely started to make any sense of it.” ([Steam Community][7])

---

### 3. **Poor organization of core gameplay features**

Certain gameplay features (e.g. acrobatics, mounting, auto navigation, skill categories) are placed in unexpected or illogical menu spots, undermining usability.

> “The acrobatic skills are in a really weird sub menu, when they should just be put together with the other skills or at least be on the same page as the resonance acrobatic abilities.” ([Reddit][4])
> “The mounting function for auto navigation messes up the system really badly … half the time … ‘unable to summon mount imagine’ because it tries to mount first before teleporting … or are in combat.” ([Reddit][4])

---

### 4. **Interruptive and forced UI flow**

Some features, like dialogues or cutscenes, force the player to engage with UI in disruptive ways (e.g. holding a button to skip). That leads to frustration, especially when players just want to move or skip.

> “Having to hold a button to skip cutscenes is almost unforgivable, fortunately you can skip instantly by clicking the button.” ([Reddit][4])

Additionally, the gating of progression via menu systems (daily tasks, checklists) amplifies the feel of UI as a “wall” rather than a conduit.

---

## Effects on Player Experience

* **Reduced immersion:** Instead of diving into the world, you're repeatedly diverted to menus, windows, and microtransaction screens.
* **Cognitive overhead:** New or casual players must memorize where to find common actions (inventory, mounts, acrobatics, etc.) due to poor layout.
* **Fatigue from click fatigue:** The sheer number of menu interactions leads to fatigue and frustration, particularly in repeated daily routines.
* **Barrier to efficient play:** Progression, crafting, equipping, checking stats — all become slower not due to loads or lag, but due to UI friction.
* **Perception shift toward “mobile / gacha” identity:** The UI design choices reinforce the idea among many players that SR is more a mobile gacha game ported to PC than a fully-fledged MMO.

One user put it bluntly:

> “It just doesn’t feel like a real Game. … you constantly have to click through dozens of reward screens, daily missions, pop-ups, and unnecessary systems.” ([Steam Community][6])

---

## Structural & Design Suggestions (for future updates)

To make the UI / menu system more usable and less burdensome, these changes could help:

1. **Flatten menu hierarchies** — reduce depth by merging related submenus and surfacing core features.
2. **Customizable quick access / favorites bar** — let users pin frequently used features (mounts, skills, crafts).
3. **Contextual menus** — show only relevant options depending on your state (in combat, in town, in dungeon).
4. **Limit popups / reward screens** — batch daily rewards or optional claim windows.
5. **Better labeling & consistency** — ensure that similar functions (e.g. all “acies” skills) group together.
6. **Tutorial / guided UI onboarding** — especially for features unlocked later, guide users in context.
7. **Responsive UI layout / scaling** — let users adjust UI size, grid, or rearrange key interface panels.

---

## Conclusion

The **menu and UI system** in BPSR is widely criticized in its community as **overcomplicated, bloated, unintuitive, and mobile-gacha in feel**. While underlying systems (crafting, progression, combat) may have merits, they’re often overshadowed by the negative user experience imposed by the interface.

If the developers intend this to be a long-term game, **streamlining the UI** and rethinking menu flows should be a priority — because no matter how good a game is under the hood, if the UI is a chore to navigate, many players will abandon it early.

a **menu bug / complaint list** from community feedback, then sketched a **redesigned menu flow mockup** to contrast. You can use this to argue for UI improvements:

## I. Menu Bug / UI Complaint List (from Community Reports)

Here are recurring issues and frustrations users report (Reddit, Steam, forums):

| Issue                                                 | Description / Example                                                                                                                       | Source / Quote                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unintuitive menu layout & deep nesting**            | Players struggle to find basic functions because they are buried under submenus.                                                            | > “SR’s menu system can be unintuitive. There are often too many nested menus, making it difficult to locate specific options.” ([Reddit][1])                                                                     |
| **Text overload / heavy UI language**                 | Menus have lots of text, many currencies, and distinctions hard to grasp for new players.                                                   | In a beta discussion: > “It’s quite text heavy and really, not introducing you very well to the in game currency types / cash shop items and the differences between all of that.” ([ResetEra][2])                |
| **Full screen / display mode bug**                    | Full screen mode only works when the resolution matches the monitor’s max — players with 1080p can’t force true full screen.                | From a game settings guide: "Blue Protocol Star Resonance doesn’t properly support lower full screen resolutions. The full screen toggle is locked behind your monitor’s native resolution ..." ([GamerBlurb][3]) |
| **Server / launcher region lock / server list error** | Some players can’t even retrieve server list or login because of region restrictions / locking in the launcher UI.                          | PCGamesN: > “Blue Protocol Star Resonance appears to be region-locked … the only way to fix … is through the use of a VPN.” ([PCGamesN][4])                                                                       |
| **Perception of “gacha / mobile-style” UI behavior**  | Many feel the UI is more like a mobile gacha game than an MMO, probably due to the numerous popups, stores, and currency windows.           | > “The menus and UI and currencies really pissed me off. It’s overly bloated … makes it feel like a gacha game.” ([Reddit][1])                                                                                    |
| **Popup / reward screen spam**                        | Users complain about being forced through too many reward windows, daily claims, UI interrupts.                                             | > “You constantly have to click through dozens of reward screens, daily missions, pop-ups, and unnecessary systems.” (Steam comment) ([Steam Community][5])                                                       |
| **Difficulty in scaling / display settings**          | UI scaling or display adjustments are limited; users with non-native or lower resolutions struggle.                                         | See the full screen bug note above.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Ambiguous currency systems**                        | Multiple “orb / bound / unbound / gold / reputation” types are confusing. Some users say they weren’t properly introduced in tutorial / UI. | > “Not introducing you very well to … in game currency types / cash shop items and the differences” ([ResetEra][2])                                                                                               |
| **Crash / stability / UI glitch complaints**          | Some players report crashes or UI errors in the Steam forums, though less focused on menu structure.                                        | Steam Discussions: “Game keeps crashing.” ([Steam Community][6])                                                                                                                                                  |

## II. Redesigned Menu Flow Mockup (Better UX Proposal)

Below is a **mockup of an improved menu flow / structure** (ASCII style) that addresses many of the complaints above — flattening depth, clearly separating core features, adding favorites, contextual UI, and reducing overload. Use it as a reference or pitch.

---

```
MAIN MENU (ESC)
=============================
| Quick-Access Bar (persistent) |
| [ Inventory ] [ Skills ] [ Map ] [ Quests ] [ Social ] [ Crafting ] [ Shop ] [ Settings ] |

   - Gear
   - Modules
   - Materials

 2. Skills
   - Active / Passive / Talent
   - Acrobatic / Movement Skills (grouped logically)
   - Loadouts

 3. Map
   - Region / Filters / Teleports
   - Markers & Waypoints

 4. Quests
   - Main / Side / Event / Trackable
   - Rewards

 5. Social
   - Party / Guild / Friends / Mail / Chat

 6. Crafting & Life Skills
   - Gathering
     * Botany / Mineralogy / Gemology
   - Crafting
     * Smelting / Weaving / Alchemy / Culinary / Artisanry / Gemcrafting

| → Player can pin e.g. Mounts, Crafting, Guild, etc. |
-----------------------------------

CONTEXTUAL / IN-WORLD QUICK MENU
------------------------------------
When in town / near NPC:
  - [Interact] → sub options: Shop, Exchange, Craft Station
  - Local map / fast travel

When in dungeon / combat:
  - Reduced menu (no store, no world map)
  - Quick rebindable shortcuts

NOTIFICATIONS & DAILY REWARDS PANEL
------------------------------------
- On login, show collapsible daily reward UI (batch claim)
- No forced popups for every reward
- Summary dashboard (pending rewards, events) instead of constant windows

CURRENCY / WALLET PANEL
-------------------------
- Single “Wallet / Currencies” screen
- Shows all types: Gold, Orbs (bound/unbound), Honor, Reputation, Vault keys
- Hover / tooltips explain each type
- Highlight which shops accept which currency (UI link)

TOOLTIP / HELP LAYER
-----------------------
- Contextual tooltips when hovering over menu items (esp currencies or ambiguous names)
- “New?” badges for freshly unlocked UI elements

UI SCALING & LAYOUT
---------------------
- Allow resizing / scaling of UI (text / icons)
- Layout presets (Compact / Standard / Expanded)
- Option to hide or collapse side panels
```

## III. Comparison (Current vs Proposed)

| Problem                            | Current Behavior                                        | Proposed Fix                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deep menu nesting                  | Many sub-levels to reach basic functions                | Flatten to 2–3 levels; use top quick bar                        |
| Clutter & overload                 | Too many popups, multiple stores and currencies visible | Consolidate reward popups; separate wallet UI                   |
| Ambiguous currencies               | Multiple orb / bound / shop currencies confusing        | One wallet screen with explanations                             |
| Poor full-screen support / scaling | Full screen locked to max resolution ([GamerBlurb][3])  | Provide scaling & display modes                                 |
| Region lock errors                 | Can't log in / server list UI blocked ([PCGamesN][4])   | Clear server region UI / fallback or region selection layer     |
| Buried life skills / crafting      | Crafting and gathering mixed / hidden                   | One dedicated “Crafting & Life Skills” menu                     |
| UI feel too mobile / gacha         | Frequent cash shop windows and reward screens           | Isolate shop UI; don’t force cash shop overlays during gameplay |
